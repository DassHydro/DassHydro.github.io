The team brings together expertise in computational sciences, hydrology, hydraulics, mathematical models and methods, inverse problems, statistical inference, sensitivity analysis, data assimilation, reduced models, and hybrid physically informed AI models.
The objectives of MathHydroNum are to design new generation models, numerical methods, algorithms, and computational softwares that address scientific challenges in the following areas:</description></item><item><title>Members</title><link>https://dasshydro.github.io/the_team/team_members/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jun 2023 15:24:12 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dasshydro.github.io/the_team/team_members/</guid><description>Founders and lead INSA Toulouse - IMT INRAE Aix (UMR RECOVER) Jérôme Monnier (Professor) Webpage Pierre-André Garambois (Researcher) Webpage Collaborators INSA Toulouse - IMT INRAE Aix (UMR RECOVER) Robin Bouclier (Professor) Webpage Benjamin Renard (Researcher) Olivier Roustant (Professor) Webpage François Colleoni (R&amp;amp;D Engineer) Mustapha Allabou (Ph.D. Student 2021-24) Truyen Huynh (Ph.D. student 2022-25) Hugo Boulenc (Ph.D. Student 2022-25) HydroMatters HydroSciences Montpellier Kévin Larnier (R&amp;amp;D Engineer) Webpage Léo Pujol (postdoctoral researcher) Webpage Adrien Paris (R&amp;amp;D Engineer) Stéphane Calmant (Scientific Director (Emeritus IRD) Engees-Icube SERTIT-Icube Guilhem Dellinger (Associate professor) Webpage Alessandro Caretto (R&amp;amp;D engineer) IMFT - INPT International Helene Roux (Professor) Webpage Shangzhi Chen (Assistant Professor, Anhui University of Science and Technology in China) Webpage Co-funders</description></item></channel></rss>
